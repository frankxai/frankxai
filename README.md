I came up through enterprise AI — Oracle Cloud solution design, AI Centers of Excellence, multi-agent systems that had to work at production scale. That foundation is what makes the creator tooling architecturally sound rather than just experimental.

The open-source work is three interlocking projects that form a complete stack.

## The Stack

| Layer | Project | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Memory** | [Starlight Intelligence System](https://github.com/frankxai/Starlight-Intelligence-System) | Persistent context layer for AI agents. 5-layer cognitive architecture, behavioral learning from every session, 7 specialist agents, 6 memory vaults, 6 platform adapters. |
| **Operation** | [Agentic Creator OS](https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os) | The runtime. 90+ skills, 65+ commands, 38 agents, 8 plugins. Native to Claude Code; works with Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI. |
| **Universe** | [Arcanea](https://github.com/frankxai/arcanea) | Living creative intelligence. 10 Guardian intelligences, context that compounds across sessions, mythology-infused world-building for creators who want to build something that lasts. |

SIS provides memory. ACOS provides operation. Arcanea provides the world to build inside. They're not three separate experiments — they're one architecture split across layers.

## Other Projects

**[agentic-creator-skills](https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-skills)** — Plugin marketplace for ACOS. 8 plugins: core, content-engine, visual-studio, music-lab, brand-architect, product-launcher, intelligence, design-excellence.

**[claude-code-hooks](https://github.com/frankxai/claude-code-hooks)** — Production-grade hook system for Claude Code. Quality gates, circuit breakers, audit trails. 15 hooks across 6 lifecycle events — extracted from running it in production for 155+ sessions.

**[context-engineering-for-creators](https://github.com/frankxai/context-engineering-for-creators)** — Context engineering patterns for AI-native creators with auto-activating skills. Targeting the gap between chat interfaces and real agentic systems.

**[suno-mcp-server](https://github.com/frankxai/suno-mcp-server)** — MCP server for Suno AI music generation. Create, manage, and iterate on music directly from Claude Code.

**[claude-skills-library](https://github.com/frankxai/claude-skills-library)** — Professional-grade skills for Claude Code. Covers architecture, content, design, music, and ops patterns.

**[ai-architect-academy](https://github.com/frankxai/ai-architect-academy)** — Guides and patterns for building AI Centers of Excellence in enterprise environments.

**[storage-intelligence](https://github.com/frankxai/storage-intelligence)** — WSL-aware developer disk cleanup with AI safety council. Finds what to delete without destroying your environment.

**[knowledge-work-plugins](https://github.com/frankxai/knowledge-work-plugins)** — Open source plugins for knowledge workers in Claude Code. Creator plugin covers voice-consistent content, visual generation pipelines, music production, and brand memory.

**[arcanea-intelligence-os](https://github.com/frankxai/arcanea-intelligence-os)** — Mythology-infused agentic orchestration. Guardian swarm coordination for creative world-building at scale.

**[vibe-os](https://github.com/frankxai/vibe-os)** — Research-backed frequency healing audio generation and AI music integration.

## Background

Enterprise side: Oracle-certified AI Architect, solution design for AI Centers of Excellence, multi-cloud infrastructure, systems that need to work before they can scale. That work continues through [oci-ai-architects](https://github.com/oci-ai-architects).

Creator side: 12,000+ AI songs made, which meant living with broken tooling every day — sessions that reset, nothing that remembered, no system that compounded. So I built the stack to fix that. SIS, ACOS, and Arcanea are that stack, open-sourced.

- Oracle-certified AI Architect
- 12,000+ AI songs created
- 85+ repositories across 4 GitHub organizations
- [frankx.ai](https://frankx.ai) — the platform, built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, and ACOS

## Organizations

**[frankxai](https://github.com/frankxai)** — Core infrastructure: SIS, ACOS, Arcanea, creator tools, developer utilities.

**[Arcanea-Labs](https://github.com/Arcanea-Labs)** — Creative intelligence platform. Open-source agents and companion systems for creators building universes.

**[oci-ai-architects](https://github.com/oci-ai-architects)** — Skills and architecture patterns for enterprise AI on Oracle Cloud, Cline, and multi-cloud infrastructure.
