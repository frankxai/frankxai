I build agent systems, creative tooling, and open source infrastructure. Most of my work lives at the intersection of multi-agent orchestration, AI coding workflows, and shipping things that actually work.

### Projects

**[Agentic Creator OS](https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os)** — Claude Code-native productivity system. 130+ commands, 630+ skills, 40+ agents.

**[Arcanea](https://github.com/frankxai/arcanea)** — Open source creative intelligence framework. Agents, skills, and lore for AI-powered creative work.

**[AI Architect Academy](https://github.com/frankxai/ai-architect-academy)** — Guides and patterns for building AI Centers of Excellence.


### Organizations

**[oci-ai-architects](https://github.com/oci-ai-architects)** — Skills and workflows for AI Architects. Claude Code, Cline, Oracle Cloud, and multi-cloud infrastructure patterns.

**[Arcanea-Labs](https://github.com/Arcanea-Labs)** — Creative intelligence platform. Open source agents and companion systems for creators.

### Current Focus

- Automation workflows and AI architect patterns with coding agents
